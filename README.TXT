Hey Guys,

This is the old source for V2 (DJGPP), along with the sources for the utils (mostly DJGPP), the VCC compiler (DJGPP; though it should compiler under Watcom), and MapEd 2 (Watcom). Just getting this out the door. The new source will be released and updated regularly a week or so from now, so you can futz around with this until that time.

I'm not sure the main engine even runs in this build, as all I got from compiling and running it was a fistful of page faults. Sorry, I don't feel like trying to make it work. It's old and stinky (enjoy! ^_^). It may be VC incompatibilities with newer stuff, it may be some minor oversight on my part from tweaking it at some point, it could by anything.

The utils and MapEd 2 seemed to be in working order, however. Didn't include all the util sources, because they're hidden somewhere on my hard drive. I'll find them later (like when I clean this cluttered mess of a hard drive).

I removed the CD audio code, because of GPL issues and it was a shoddy interface to begin with. I didn't take the FLI code out, though I can't remember where I got it from. It's likely I nabbed it up from X2FTP or some similar archive. If you can figure out where it's from and if I'm violating the GPL by including it (though I hacked it up a bit), just send me some proof of its origin and license and I'll remove it.

Otherwise, wham. There ya go. If you have any questions about it, just drop me a line and I'll see what I can do. Happy New Year, and have fun with it... Or possibly heaping gobs of frustration. :-)
